### Description

This is an excellent database program the screen shot speaks for itself has a lot off features. Basicly for storing and keeping track of employees. "PLEASE RATE IT IF YOU LIKE IT" it also has a custom CD Player built in. I will be uploading version 2.0 in 1 week so keep an eye out for it cause if you like this you'll love version 2.0. Still a littly buggy but it's still in its beta stage. Thanks PSC
